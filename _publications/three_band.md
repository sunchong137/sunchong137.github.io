title: "Ground-state phase diagram of the three-band Hubbard model from density matrix embedding theory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/threeband
excerpt: 'Three-band Hubbard model is a good model-approximation to the two-dimensional cuprate layer, which is the key structure of copper-based high-temperature superconductors. This paper applied density matrix embedding theory (DMET) to simulating the magnetic order and pairing parameters of the three-band Hubbard model with dopping, and shed light on understanding the mechanism of
high Tc superconductors.  '

Three-band Hubbard model is a good model-approximation to the two-dimensional cuprate layer, which is the key structure of copper-based high-temperature superconductors. This paper applied density matrix embedding theory (DMET) to simulating the magnetic order and pairing parameters of the three-band Hubbard model with dopping, and shed light on understanding the mechanism of
high Tc superconductors.
