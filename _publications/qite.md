title: "Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/qite2020
excerpt: 'This paper provides a quantum algorithm for imaginary time evolution (ITE). The biggest
challenge of implementing ITE on a quantum computer is that the ITE operator is non-unitary. Unlike the popular block encoding approach, our algorithm does not require ancillary qubits. The key is to utilize the entanglement pattern of a physical system.'
