title: "Waveflow: Enforcing boundary conditions in smooth normalizing flows with application to fermionic wave functions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/waveflow
excerpt: 'This paper applies physical constraints onto normalizing flows in order to 
sample many-electron wavefunctions. Unlike most wavefunction-based methods where the Slater determinants are used to encode antisymmetry, the antisymmetric property of fermionic wavefunctions is encoded directly
in the construction of the normalizing flows with certain boundary conditions. We call the proposed scheme "waveflows".'
