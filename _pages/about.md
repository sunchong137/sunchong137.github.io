Hi, my name is Chong Sun [孙 (Sun1) 冲 (Chong1) in Chinese], a theoretical and computational
chemist. 
I will be joining the [Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology](https://chem.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers-New Brunswick as an assistant professor starting Fall 2025. The Sun Group is actively recruiting students and postdocs, please reach out to me via chong[dot]sun[at]rutgers[dot]edu.

<!-- Currently, I am a research scientist at Microsoft Quantum and a postdoctoral fellow at Rice
University with [Prof. Gustavo Scuseria](http://scuseria.rice.edu/).
I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 2021, advised by [Prof. Garnet Kin-Lic Chan](https://www.chan-lab.caltech.edu/) focusing on developing numerical methods for strongly correlated systems.
My dissertation is on [Finite-Temperature Simulations of Strongly Correlationed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14313). I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Alan Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) on interdisciplinary research  for electronic structures. -->
