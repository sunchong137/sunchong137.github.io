### Selected non-orthogonal configuration interaction with compressed single and double excitations ([Link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00240))

  <p> We derived elegant formulae to compress a linear combination of orthogonal particle-hole excitations into a much shorter non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI). We further combine this strategy to add dynamic correlation to an NOCI reference, providing a systematically improvable approach to add arbitrary rank of excitations to a multi-reference wavefunction. </p>

### Waveflow: boundary-conditioned normalizing flows applied to fermionic wavefunctions ([Link](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/2/4/046106/3319478/Waveflow-Boundary-conditioned-normalizing-flows9))

  <p> We introduced Waveflow, an innovative framework for learning many-body fermionic wavefunctions with boundary-conditioned normalizing flows. Rather than relying on Slater determinants, Waveflow achieves antisymmetry by defining the wavefunction's fundamental domain and enforcing the appropriate boundary conditions. Furthermore, we introduced a method for relaxing both the prior distribution and the flow, enabling us to overcome the longstanding topological mismatch problem in normalizing flows. </p>

### Electron localization in disordered quantum systems at finite temperatures ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16868))

**C. Sun**, arXiv:2403.16868 [cond-mat.dis-nn]

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="../images/publications/mbl2024/compol_fig2.png" alt="Description" style="width: 200px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p> Disordered quantum systems exhibiting many-body localization (MBL) hold promise as noise-resilient materials for quantum computing. In this work, we investigate electron localization within disordered quantum systems, examining both individual eigenstates and thermal states. We use complex polarization as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the mean-field approximation in delivering a quantitative analysis of these systems. </p>

### Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution ([Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0704-4))

  <p> This work provides a quantum algorithm for imaginary time evolution (ITE). The biggest
challenge of implementing ITE on a quantum computer is that the ITE operator is non-unitary. Unlike the popular block encoding approach, our algorithm does not require ancillary qubits. The key is to utilize the entanglement pattern of a physical system.  </p>

### Finite-temperature density matrix embedding theory ([Link](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.075131))

**C. Sun** (Corresponding Author), U. Ray, Z.-H. Cui, M. Stoudenmire, M. Ferrero, and G. K.-L. Chan. Phys. Rev. B 101, 075131 (2020)

This paper provides a new vision on the behavior of entanglement at finite temperature. It also provides a numerical algorithm called finite-temperature density matrix embedding theory (FT-DMET), which is powerful for computing observables and phase diagrams for strongly correlated systems at finite temperature.

### Ground-state phase diagram of the three-band Hubbard model from density matrix embedding theory ([Link](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043259))

Zhi-Hao Cui, **Chong Sun**, et. al. Phys. Rev. Research 2, 043259(2020)

Three-band Hubbard model is a good model-approximation to the two-dimensional cuprate layer, which is the key structure of copper-based high-temperature superconductors. This paper applied density matrix embedding theory (DMET) to simulating the magnetic order and pairing parameters of the three-band Hubbard model with dopping, and shed light on understanding the mechanism of high Tc superconductors.

### Monte-Carlo simulations of spin-crossover phenomena based on a vibronic Ising-like model with realistic parameters ([Link](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/cp/c4cp05562d/unauth))

This work used realistic lattice parameters derived from density functional theory (DFT) simulations to study the spin crossover (SCO) behavior of the [Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4]·2H2O lattice. We simplified the complex lattice with an Ising-like model with elastic coupling between SCO centers. We profiled the thermal hysteresis of this SCO systems with Monte Carlo simulation.
