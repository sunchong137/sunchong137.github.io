# Installation

VMD is free to download from the UIUC Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group [website](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD). I installed Version 1.9.3, as recommended. The installation is standard. 

# Generating a cube file

VMD supports many file types. Here we focus on the `.cube` files, which is used in Gaussian09. In PySCF, there is a module in tools called `cubegen.py`, which can produce `.cube` files storing the electronic density, orbital and molecular electrostatic potential. Here is an example:

```python
from pyscf import scf
from pyscf.tools import cubegen
mol = gto.M(atom='''O 0.00000000,  0.000000,  0.000000
										H 0.761561, 0.478993, 0.00000000
                    H -0.761561, 0.478993, 0.00000000''', basis='6-31g*')
mf = scf.RHF(mol).run()
cubegen.density(mol, 'h2o_den.cube', mf.make_rdm1()) #makes total density
cubegen.mep(mol, 'h2o_pot.cube', mf.make_rdm1())
cubegen.orbital(mol, 'h2o_mo1.cube', mf.mo_coeff[:,0])
```

In the above example, one can change `mf.mo_coeff[:, 0]` to other orbitals by changing the orbital index. 

# Loading a molecule

In the VMD main window, click on **File** → **New Molecule**, then click on **Browse** to select the cube file to load. Finally click on **Load**.

One can keep on loading other `.cube` files to the current molecule by selecting the molecule, and **File** → **Load Data into Molecule**.

# Changing the design

The original color scheme can be hard to read, one should change the background and representations for a better view. 

## Background settings

One can choose the background to be solid color or gradient color in the VMD main: **Display** → **Background**.

To change the color, open **Graphics** → **Colors**. In the **Categories** window, select **Display**, then in the **Names** window, select **Background** to change the solid color; **BackgroundTop** and **BackgroundBot** to change the gradient color.  

## Representations of the Molecule

The default of the molecules are dots, and to make the molecules prettier, one needs to change the representations. In VMD Main, open **Graphics** → **Representation**. 

1. Choose the atoms to edit in the **Select Atoms** window, **all** means all atoms, **type 1** means type 1 atoms, etc.
2. Choose the **Coloring Method**, for molecules, one can choose **Element** or **Mass**, and the **Drawing Method** can be **VDW** for spheres,  **CPK** for spheres and bonds. One should change the Sphere scale and bond scale to make the best illustration. In the following, we show H2O molecule with VDW (left) and CPK (right) respectively.

</figure>
 

The CPK form can be generated with two layers of representations. One can click on **Create Rep** to create a new layer and **Delete Rep** to delete a layer. In order to make the CPK style, one create one layer with **VDW,** and one layer with **Dynamic Bonds**. 

## Plot orbital

The `.cube` file for orbital information is created by `cubegen.orbital` . On top of the molecules created above, one can plot the charge density. The following are still in **Graphics** → **Representations**.

1. Create a new layer, and choose **Drawing Method** as **Isosurface**. At the bottom right, choose **Draw** to be **Solid Surface**, and **Show** to be **Isosurface**. 
2. Change the **Isovalue** (one can drag the bar on the right) to change the charge value to show (can be negative or positive). One can also change the **Range** of the Isovalue. Set **Material** to be **Transparent**.
3. To assign different colors to positive and negative charge density, create a layer as in Step 2, and choose the **Coloring Method** to be **ColorID.** Set **Isovalue** to be a negative value and choose the number beside the **Coloring Method** to be, say 0 (Blue). Then create another layer, and set the **Isovalue** to be positive, and choose another number of color, say 1 (red). 

An example of the HOMO of H2O is

# Saving the image

One can save the image to the PostScript (.ps) form. Open **File** → **Render**. In the **Render the current scene using:** window, choose **PostScript (vector graphics)**. One can set the path and name to save.

To convert the .ps file into PDF, in the command line, install ghostview by `sudo apt install ghostview` . Then use `ps2pdf file.ps file.pdf` to convert to pdf.
